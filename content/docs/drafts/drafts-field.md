## What is "A draft field"?

Draft fields are just boolean fields that can be used to indicate whether a document is a draft or not. There is nothing special about draft fields are they are not treaded any differently then any other boolean fields.

### Setting up a draft field

The field can be added to the top level fields of a collection.

```ts
const schema = defineSchema({
  collections: [
    {
      name: 'post',
      label: 'Post',
      path: 'content/posts',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'draft',
          label: 'Draft',
          type: 'boolean',
          required: true,
          description: 'If this is checked the post will not be published',
        },
        // ... other fields
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

> Note: when draft fields must be required. This may require adding it to existing documents.

Now when you query the data you only look for documents that are not drafts.

```ts
// getting production posts
const req = await client.queries.postConnection({
  filter: { draft: { eq: false } },
})

// getting all posts
const req = await client.queries.postConnection()
```

Read more about querying data [here](/docs/data-fetching/overview).

## Potential issues

- Drafts can not be [contextual edited](/docs/contextual-editing/overview) as they are not published. To add contextual editing to drafts see this documentation [here]().

## Examples in Next.js

### Naive example

This is an example of how to use draft fields in a Next.js app. This example is naive and does not handle contextual editing of draft documents

```tsx
// pages/blog/[slug].tsx
import { useTina } from 'tinacms/dist/react'

const BlogPage = ({ data: postData, query, variables }: PageProps) => {
  const { data } = useTina({ data: postData, query, variables })

  // .. Your blog page
}

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async function ({ params }) {
  const relativePath = (params?.slug as string) + '.md'
  const tinaProps = await client.queries.postAndFeaturePosts({ relativePath })
  return {
    props: {
      ...tinaProps,
    },
  }
}

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const postsListData = await client.queries.postConnection({
    filter: { draft: { eq: false } },
  })
  const res: GetStaticPathsResult<{ slug: string }> = {
    paths:
      postsListData.data.postConnection?.edges?.map((post) => ({
        params: { slug: post?.node?._sys.filename || '' },
      })) || [],
    fallback: true,
  }

  return res
}

export default BlogPage
```

The problem with this approach is that the `getStaticPaths` function will not be able to find draft documents. This means that when you go to contextual edit a draft document it will not be found.

There are two solutions to this problem:

- Return all documents in `getStaticPaths` but don't show them in your blog listing page.
  - this means they will be available for contextual editing but will also be available to the public
- Do two separate builds of your application
  - One build shows the draft documents and can be served from a different domain.
  - One build for the public that does not show the draft documents. -->
