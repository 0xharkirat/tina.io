> NOTE: Drafts are in an initial stage. While this while these methods of drafts will be supported, our final version of drafts will be easier to use and will require less setup.

Currently TinaCMS supports a few different ways to handle drafts. This document will give an overview of the different ways to handle drafts and how to configure them.

## A draft field

Drafts fields are not special, they are just fields that have the boolean type. They can be used to indicate weather a document is a draft or not. This is the most basic way to handle drafts but requires some changes to the way you fetch your data.

## Working with branches

For more advanced use cases you can use branches to handle drafts.
