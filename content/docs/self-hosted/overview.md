When running a Tina site in production, you need to connect it to [Tina Cloud](/docs/tina-cloud/ "") for user authentication and to handle the communication with GitHub.

**We also offer a self-hosted alternative to Tina Cloud**;  A simple backend that you can host yourself so you're not locked into Tina Cloud. We love the control and portability you get when storing content in Markdown and JSON files and want to extend that to the rest of the CMS.

If you're interested in self-hosting Tina, you can read about this solution on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/discussions/3096 ""). &#x20;

**Note -** Most of TinaCMS is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, but the GraphQL package required to self-host TinaCMS is released under a modified version of the Fair Source License.  You can find this license [here](# "") and  its corresponding FAQ, [here](# "").&#x20;
