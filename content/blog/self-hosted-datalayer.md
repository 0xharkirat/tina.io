Today we're excited to announce the first iteration of TinaCMS's self-hosted Data Layer. This has been a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/discussions/3096 "") for a variety of reasons. Some feedback we've heard:

* "We want flexibility to eject from Tina Cloud down the road"
* "We need our content stored on-premise"
* "We need to host the servers in a particular region"
* "We want to use our custom authentication that isn't supported in Tina Cloud"
* We want to customize/extend the behaviour used within Tina Cloud"

By self-hosting the Tina Data Layer, you can run TinaCMS without lock-in to Tina Cloud.&#x20;

We're excited to get this in the community's hands so that we can learn, iterate, and flesh out the self-hosted experience.

## What is the Tina Data Layer

The Tina Data Layer provides a GraphQL API that serves Markdown and JSON files. The Data Layer’s *store* is a key-value database. You can think of the store like a cache since the single source of truth for your content is really your Markdown/JSON files. The Data Layer's store can be swapped for any database using adapters.&#x20;

## Why does TinaCMS need a Data Layer when I store my content in Markdown files?

As mentioned above, your Markdown files are the source of truth but TinaCMS still requires the Data Layer to do its job. This includes things like content search, pagination, references between Markdown files, and more.&#x20;

Also, since the Data Layer provides an API, you can fetch your content like you would with a traditional headless CMS.  This opens up your file-based content to dynamic sites that use server-side rendering.&#x20;

When you’re developing your site locally, the Data Layer doesn’t need to be configured and just runs in the background. If you use Tina Cloud in production, it handles your Tina Data Layer and syncs with GitHub.&#x20;

Now, we’re giving users the ability to self-host the Tina Data Layer so you’re not dependant on Tina Cloud.

## Is the Tina Data Layer open-source?

Most of TinaCMS is open-source under the Apache 2.0 but we chose to use a [source-available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) license for the Tina Data Layer. This license has a limit to the commercial usage but allows us to offer a cost-free, self-hosted solution for smaller sites like those at startups, small and medium businesses, or other simple use-cases. Source available licenses are used with many companies like MongoDB, Elastic, and Sentry.  Read the [license](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/main/packages/%40tinacms/datalayer/LICENSE) and related [FAQ](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/main/packages/@tinacms/datalayer/LICENSE-FAQ.md) for more details.&#x20;

## Where can I host it?

We've designed the Data Layer so that it can be hosted as a Serverless function alongside your site (with Vercel/Netlify functions). You can also host it as a long function API function wherever you like!

## Try it out!
