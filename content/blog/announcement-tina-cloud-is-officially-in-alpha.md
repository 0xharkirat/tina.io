The team at Tina is pleased to announced that [Tina Cloud](https://tina.io/cloud/) is officially in Alpha. We have been working incredibly hard behind the scenes to get our vision in the hands of developers and content teams.

Tina Cloud brings the power of Tina's open-source content editor with a GraphQL API that allows you to interact with your Markdown files stored in your repository.

> Scott should talk a bit about the vision of Tina here (how did we get here from there)

## What to Expect with the Tina Cloud Alpha?

Tina cloud is being actively developed on, but is in a place we believe you can have a great experience with it. This means you may run into occasional bugs or be required to update to the latest version because we have improved our API.

Tina cloud is missing a some features which we will be adding in the near future:

* Media Management Solution
* Multi-branch workflows
* Read-only tokens for our GraphQL API. That means it's only used when you are editing content.

## What tech stack should be used with Tina Cloud

* [**NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/): NextJS is a perfect match for our product and is the default choice for everyone at the company.
* [**GitHub**](https://github.com):  GitHub is required as it is the only Git provider we support on Tina Cloud currently, in the future we hope to bring on others.
* **Static, file-based builds** : When you go to build our Tina Cloud product collects your filesystem content, in the future you will be able to fetch data from our cloud API during build times.

## How can I get started?

The first thing you will want to do is signup for [Tina Cloud](https://auth.tina.io/register), once you have signed up for the Alpha, the Tina team has created a few ways to get started with Tina Cloud and get up and running in minutes.

* [Tina Cloud Starter](): A basic implementation of Tina Cloud that allows you to get up and running in a few minutes.
* [Add Tina Cloud to an existing site](https://tina.io/guides/tina-cloud/existing-site/overview/) - We provide a guide to show you have to take the NextJS starter and add Tina Cloud.
