TinaCMS Version `1.1.4` (and `@tinacms/cli@1.0.7`) adds the ability to store content in separate repo's, improvements to the rich-text field, adds the ability to rename documents, and several other bug fixes.

## Storing Content in a Separate Repo

Tina now supports sourcing content from a separate Git repo. With this approach you can continue to define your Tina config in your "website repo", but documents will be saved elsewhere.\
