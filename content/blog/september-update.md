## Documentation Cycle Recap

Tina is a toolkit for developers, so documentation is essential. If a feature is not well-documented, it might as well not exist. In light of this, we've spent the past several weeks improving the usability of the documentation on [tinacms.org](). We've reorganized the docs and written some new ones, improved the functionality of our search, and are now importing the package docs [directly from GitHub]() to ensure they are always in sync.

Additionally, in an effort to continuously improve our documentation, we've added a **feedback form** at the bottom of our docs. If you're reading a doc that seems incomplete or is difficult to comprehend, go ahead and give us a thumbs down and tell us why!

## Up Next: Media Management

We've decided to begin implementing a Media Manager as described in our [Media API RFC](). Currently, logic for handling uploads is contained within individual image fields, and there's no way to insert a previously-uploaded image into a piece of content. Centralizing media management promises to solve this problem, and likely fix some other quality-of-life issues we've encountered along the way.

If you want to keep tabs on our progress, take a look at the Media Manager project in GitHub.

## TinaCMS Office Hours

The Tina Open Source Team will be conducting bi-weekly office hours. Anyone interested in Tina is welcome to drop in with questions or feedback.

Our first office hours session will be on September 11th from 10AM-11AM EDT (7AM-8AM PDT). We plan to alternate between morning and afternoon time slots to accommodate as many timezones as we can.
