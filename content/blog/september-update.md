## Documentation Cycle Recap

Tina is a toolkit for developers, so documentation is essential. If a feature is not well-documented, it might as well not exist. In light of this, we've spent the past several weeks improving the usability of the documentation on [tinacms.org](). We've reorganized the docs and written some new ones, improved the functionality of our search, and are now importing the package docs [directly from GitHub]() to ensure they are always in sync.

Additionally, in an effort to continuously improve our documentation, we've added a **feedback form** at the bottom of our docs. If you're reading a doc that seems incomplete or is difficult to comprehend, go ahead and give us a thumbs down and tell us why!
