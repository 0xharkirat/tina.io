In this guide, we will take you through adding Tina + Tina Cloud to a NextJS site.

We're going to use the Next.js [blog starter](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) as the base for our project. Create a new project by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash,copy
yarn create next-app -e blog-starter my-tina-blog
```

Once the site is created, **push it up as a repository to your GitHub account.**
