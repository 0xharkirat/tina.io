Open your project locally and in the `env.local` file set:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_CLIENT` to `0`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` to the Client ID copied from an earlier step and found in your app's Overview section.

Restart your server and run `yarn dev` again.

To edit the site, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/admin" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000/admin</a>. This activates the edit mode.

This time a modal asks you to authenticate through TinaCMS. Upon success, Tina will send your edits to the TinaCMS server, and subsequently to GitHub.

> To enter **edit mode**, navigate to the `admin` route of the site.

## Edit content

Make some edits through the sidebar and click save.
Changes are saved in your GitHub repository.

Now that Tina Cloud editing is working correctly, we can deploy the site so that other team members can make edits too.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Gotcha: since your changes are being synced directly to Github, you'll notice that when you're in non-"edit" mode your page still receives the unedited data from your local file system. This is mostly fine since editing with Tina Cloud is designed for hosted environments. But beware that changes to your schema may result in a mismatch between the Tina Cloud API and your local client.
