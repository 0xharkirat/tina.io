## TinaCMS Backend

While the fully local development workflow is the recommended way for developers to work,
you'll likely want other editors and collaborators to be able to make changes on a hosted website with authentication. Since we are aiming for collaboration, we will use the TinaCMS dashboard to setup our site and eventually invite other users.

## Create an Account

1. Visit <a href="https://app.tina.io/register" target="_blank">app.tina.io</a>, create an account, and signin.
2. On the landing page, you'll notice that there is an onboarding route for the Tina Cloud Starter. Click '**Fork Starter in Github**' to have the dashboard walk you through the configuration needed to setup this starter as a TinaCMS app.
3. Once you create the app, click into that app's **Overview** section and copy the unique **Client ID**. You'll need this later on in this tutorial.
