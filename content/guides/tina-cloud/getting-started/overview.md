In this guide, we take you through adding TinaCMS and Tina Cloud to the Next.js blog starter. By the end of the guide you will know how to : 

- Define the shape of your content
- Use the content in `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`
- Add plugins to extend functionality
- Deploy to Tina Cloud

This will allow your content creators to edit the blog posts in real time on a deployed site on a host such as a Vercel or Netlfiy
