In this guide, we take you through adding TinaCMS and Tina Cloud to the Next.js blog starter.
With the help of TinaCMS, you will be able to edit your Next.js site in real time and by the end of this guide, your whole team will be able to edit on a deployed version of your site â€” we recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com].
