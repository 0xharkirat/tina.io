This guide will show you how to set up inline editing and inline blocks based on a simple [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) demo. The steps will be associated with tagged commits on this [demo repo](https://github.com/tinacms/inline-blocks-demo) for reference.

By the end of this guide, you should have a good understanding of how to set-up and work with inline editing and inline blocks. While this guide doesn't cover every single field or potential usecase, it should give you enough of a base to create Inline Editing experiences in your own projects.

The video above gives some reference as to what inline blocks look like in Tina. The demo we are going to set up will be more simple than what is shown in the video, but it should give you some inspiration around what's possible!

<!-- _Give a gist on what inline editing is and link to the formal API docs. Also link to the what is blocks blog._ -->

## Set-up the demo repo

### [Step 1]()

> **Tip**: The 'Steps' will link to tagged commits where the _step is complete_. If at any point you are working through a step and get tripped up, feel free to checkout the tagged commit to get some direction / reference.

<!-- Add tagged commit on the h3?-->

To get started, you'll need to clone [the repo](), install the dependencies & checkout the [**step 1 tag**](). At this point, the demo is set up with a TinaCMS instance and renders a simple `Hero` component with hard-coded data.

<!-- TODO: fill these in -->

```bash
git clone ....
cd inline-editing-demo
git checkout --some-tag...
yarn install
yarn start # Navigate to localhost:3000
```

Note that the _demo isn't meant to be a 'starter'_. It is for educational purposes to help you get familiar with the inline editing API.
