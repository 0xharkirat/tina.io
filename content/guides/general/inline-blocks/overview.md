This guide will show you how to set up inline editing and inline blocks based on a simple create-react-app demo. The steps will be associated with tagged commits on this [demo repo]() for reference. The demo isn't meant to be a 'starter'; it is for educational purposes to help you get familiar with the recently refined inline editing API.

## Set-up demo repo

### Step 1 - Clone & Install

<!-- Add tagged commit -->

To get started, you'll need to clone [the repo](), install the dependencies & checkout the [\*\*step 1 tag]().\*\* At this point, the demo is set up with a TinaCMS instance and renders a simple`Hero` component with hard-coded data.

```bash
git clone ....
cd inline-editing-demo
git checkout --some-tag...
yarn install
yarn start # Navigate to localhost:3000
```
