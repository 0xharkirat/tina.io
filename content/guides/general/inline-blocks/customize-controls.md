## Step 7 - Adjust focus ring & controls inset

The blocks controls accept extra config so you can precisely control how the controls render and behave. `insetControls` and `focusRing` are the two we will configure.

```tsx
interface BlocksControlsProps {
  children: any
  index: number
  insetControls?: boolean
  focusRing?:
    | false
    | {
        offset?: number | { x: number; y: number }
        borderRadius?: number
      }
}
```

Right now the focus ring is bleeding off the page. First, we'll adjust the offset or the amount of distance between the edge of the block element and where the 'ring' displays. And since this component is 'page-width', let's _inset_ the controls to render within the block area. This way if the block renders at the very top of the page, the controls don't get cut off.

**components/Hero.js**

```diff
export function Hero({index) {
  return (
    <BlocksControls
      index={index}
+     focusRing={{ offset: 0 }}
+     insetControls={true}
    >
      <div className="hero">
        <h1>
-         <InlineText name="headline" />
+         <InlineText name="headline" focusRing={false} />
        </h1>
        <p>
-	  <InlineTextarea name="subtext" />
+         <InlineTextarea name="subtext" focusRing={false} />
        </p>
      </div>
    </BlocksControls>
  );
}
```

Notice how we added `focusRing={false}` to the Inline Fields. This is totally up to your preference whether you want the child fields to render their focus ring. For this demo, we chose to hide them for a cleaner aesthetic.

- **Tip:** If you wanted to have even more control over the focus ring `offset`, you could pass in specific x & y offset values â€” `focusRing={{ offset: { 'x': 10, 'y': 16 } }}`
