The guides featured here will show you how to accomplish specific tasks with Tina. Guides are set up as step-by-step opportunities for learning. They are intended to introduce you to certain APIs, configurations, or workflows and provide rudimentary examples as a reference.

## How To Use

Guides should help you get familiar with a particular workflow or task. Use them to learn the basics, then refer back to the [documentation](/docs) for support in applying general solutions for your distinct needs.

Sometimes the guides will be accompanied with a demo repository â€” these aren't always meant to be starters, but rather a general reference or entry point.
