The guides featured here will show you how to accomplish specific tasks with Tina.

## How To Use

Guides are set up as step-by-step opportunities for learning, with specific guide-rails. They are intended to introduce you to certain APIs, configurations, or workflows and provide working (usually simple) examples as a reference. Sometimes the guides will be accompanied with a demo repository â€” these aren't meant to be starters, but rather a reference point for the steps outlined.

These guides are best use to get familiar with a particular workflow. Use them to learn the basics of the task you are trying to solve, then refer back to the [documentation](/docs) for support in applying general solutions for your specific needs.

At any point along the way, get support in the [community forum](https://community.tinacms.org/). If you see typos or outdated information, feel free to click the 'Edit This Site' button in the footer and open a PR to correct it.

> Before you start any guide, it is assumed that you have worked through the [Introductory Tutorial](/docs/getting-started/overview) to get familiar with Tina Basics

## Categories

Guides are organized by various categories. Guides in the _General_ category will typically use plain React (or `create-react-app`). Guides in the _Next.js_ and _Gatsby_ categories contain information specific to each framework. Typically, guides in the _General_ category can be applied to both frameworks (although the implementation may look different).
