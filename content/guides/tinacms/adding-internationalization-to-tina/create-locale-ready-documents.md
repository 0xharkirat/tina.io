Now, we'll venture into the CMS either through the Global Nav or directly via `/admin`.

For our example, we'll want to create three versions in our `post` collection by modifying the `filename` field to include each `locale`:

- `hello-world.en-US` for our "English (United States)" version
- `hello-world.fr` for our "French" version
- `hello-world.nl-NL` for our "Netherlands" version
